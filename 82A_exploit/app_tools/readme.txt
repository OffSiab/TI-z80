To make an app var of a (1 page only!) app:

prgmTEST2 will use the number in Ans as a page number for an application and will store the entire application in an ~16KB appvar called APP. Use Calcsys (Menu options: 6 -> 1 -> 3) to get the page number of the application you want to store. The page number returned by Calcsys is HEX!
